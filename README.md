## What is the ND PHP Framework?

 ND PHP Framework is a secure, fully automated framework capable of delivering full featured web applications in a matter of minutes. It's licensed under GPLv3.

## How does it work?

 Based on a drag and drop builder (the IDE Builder), you'll be able to create and visualize the application model. After the model is created, hit the Deploy button and the web application will be created, ready to be used.

## Do I need to code anything at all?

 No, if the base features of the framework already fit your needs. If not, then you'll need to extend the features by providing further parameterization and/or development.

## How to install it?

 Download the current framework version and follow the instructions in the INSTALL.txt file.

## Do I need to install a lot of dependencies?

 Probably not. Probably your GNU/Linux based operating system comes with all dependencies installed by default. Anyway, check the INSTALL.txt file for some common exceptions that you might need to do manually.

## Is it ready for production?

 NO! This is currently a PoC. There's still a lot of work to do such as cleanups, optimizations, refactorings, etc.

## Where is the documentation?

 The framework documentation is accessible through any framework web page after installation. Just press the accesskey D (in Firefox is Alt + Shift + D) and the main documentation page will be loaded.
